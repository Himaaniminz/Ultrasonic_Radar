# Ultrasonic_Radar
This project demonstrates a radar-like system that uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and a servo motor to detect objects within a specified range, with real-time visualization in Processing. The system continuously updates the radar display based on data received from an Arduino.

## Key Features:
* Object Detection:
 The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure the distance of objects 
 within a 180° sweep, detecting objects within a defined range.

*Real-Time Visualization:
The detected objects are visualized on a radar interface built in Processing, with circles representing the positions of objects.

*Dynamic Angle Updates:
The servo motor rotates the sensor between 0° and 180°, and the radar display updates in real time to reflect changes in the sensor's position.

*Distance-Based Alerts:
 Objects within a predefined range (e.g., less than 40 cm) are visually highlighted in the radar display for easy identification.

*Customizable Design:
 The radar interface includes arcs and lines to represent angles (e.g., 30°, 60°) and 
 distance markers (e.g., 10 cm, 20 cm), which can be customized as needed.
